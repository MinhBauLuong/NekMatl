# NekMatl

**NekMetl** has Nek5000 matlab codes for helping users to understand the essential components
of Nek5000 based on the **spectral element method (SEM)**[1] and allowing users
to experiment a new algorithmic implementation and 
its anaysis in an easier way using the matlab codes.



This includes demo codes:

   - Spectral element discretizations (basic components)
   - Spectral element multigrids: run `mgrid_demo.m`
   - Spectral element Navier-Stokes solver: run `nst_demo.m`
    
    

The matlab codes are authored by Paul Fischer (fischerp@illinos.edu, fischer@mcs.anl.gov)
